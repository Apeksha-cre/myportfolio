I have created a portfolio using React [My Portfolio](https://apeksha-portfolio-flowsome-eta.vercel.app/).

Steps to run this react portfolio on your localhost:

1. Clone this repository using the SSH link
2. Open it with the editor (preferred VScode)
3. Open the terminal and set the path of the folder.
4. Run the command (npm install react-scripts --save)
5. Then run (npm start).
